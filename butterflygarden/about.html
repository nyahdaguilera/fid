<h3>About Us</h3>
<h4>Fluttering Meadows is open to visitors every Tuesday and Wednesday from 10am – 2pm. Our OPEN GARDEN DAYS (with opportunities for guided tours) are the 1st and 2nd Saturdays of each month from 9am – 3pm, unless otherwise noted on the events calendar.  All are welcome to drop by to tour or volunteer on projects during open hours, we request a $5 donation per person to help continue our mission at Fluttering Meadows.   As our restoration efforts progress and funding increases, our hours of availability will continue to expand.

Pets are not permitted in the gardens. Service dogs are welcome, however; therapy support animals and pets are not permitted.  Do not leave animals in your car.

PRIVATE TOURS are available by appointment and a $10 donation per person with a minimum of $30 per tour.</h4>
